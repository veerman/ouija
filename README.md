Ouija (Double-Tap) Virtual Keyboard
=====

# About

Ouija (Double-Tap) Virtual Keyboard started in 2008 after I became frustrated with the typing experience on my 1st generation iPod Touch. The original concept was to provide double-tap key entry to eliminate all "fat-finger" typing errors (errors which occurred when tapping between two characters). The Ouija (hover-like) functionality was added later as I found it was easier to use on non-touch enabled devices.

# Usage

See index.html and js/keyboard.js

# Note

While I have included ZeroClipboard and jquery.copy js libraries in this project, they are currently not enabled as they require Flash.
